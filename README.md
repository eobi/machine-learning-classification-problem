Subtitle: A detailed look from different classification algorithms.


Introduction: 
Machine learning being a subset of artificial intelligence employs scientific algorithm and statistical models to carry out a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on data patterns and inference instead.

The process of learning begins with observation of data. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

The goal of this writeup is not to dwell much on theory however understanding the right application the right scientific method to be used is very important so data scientist don’t introduce the human error.

 

Some machine learning methods:
Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.

Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.

In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiring unlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.

Reinforcement machine learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.


For our problem context in this writeup we would use the supervised learning method hence we have historic labelled data and we are interested in predicting future occurrence also.


The seven (7) machine learning classification methods used in our context includes:
•	Logistic Regression
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
•	Kernel SVM
•	Naive Bayes
•	Decision Tree Classification
•	Random Forest Classification

Read up more about each listed regression. Okay!!! so enough of the theory let’s look into the practical of this writeup.
Going about this machine learning project we need to follow the below steps:
